									<div  class="panel-body">Chime makes money from the interchange fee charged on card transactions. Every time you use your Chime Visa® Debit Card or Credit Builder Secured Credit Card for purchases and paying bills, Visa processes the transaction and charges an interchange fee to merchants for the service. Chime receives a portion of this fee. This is how Chime can continue building new and better products that help members get the most from their money.</div>

Other features our members love about our Chime Visa Debit Card are instant transaction notifications anytime your card is swiped, the ability to instantly block your card and order a replacement Debit Card all from within the Chime mobile app.<br>

									The Chime Credit Builder Visa® Credit Card is our no fee, no interest, secured credit card that helps you build your credit. Unlike traditional credit cards, Credit Builder helps you build credit with no fees and no interest. There’s also no credit check to apply.  The money you move into Credit Builder’s secured account is the amount you can spend on the card. Unlike other secured credit cards, that money can be used to pay off your monthly balances. Since Credit Builder doesn’t have a pre-set limit, spending up to the amount you added won’t contribute to a high-utilization record on your credit history.

				<p>Chime® is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services are provided by The Bancorp Bank, N.A. or Stride Bank, N.A., Members FDIC. The Chime Visa® Debit Card and the Chime Credit Builder Visa® Credit Card are issued by The Bancorp Bank, N.A. or Stride Bank, N.A. pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. and may be used everywhere Visa debit and credit cards are accepted. Please see the back of your Card for its issuing bank.<br>

					<span class="bright">Chime Checkbook:</span> While Chime doesn’t issue personal checkbooks to write checks, Chime Checkbook gives you the freedom to send checks to anyone, anytime, from anywhere. See your issuing bank’s Deposit Account Agreement for full Chime Checkbook details.<br>

					By clicking on some of the links above, you will leave the Chime website and be directed to a third-party website. The privacy practices of those third parties may differ from those of Chime. We recommend you review the privacy statements of those third party websites, as Chime is not responsible for those third parties' privacy or security practices.<br>

					Opinions, advice, services, or other information or content expressed or contributed here by customers, users, or others, are those of the respective author(s) or contributor(s) and do not necessarily state or reflect those of The Bancorp Bank, N.A. and Stride Bank, N.A. (“Banks”). Banks are not responsible for the accuracy of any content provided by author(s) or contributor(s).<br>

					Third-party trademarks referenced for informational purposes only; no endorsements implied.<br><br>

					1 Early access to direct deposit funds depends on the timing of the submission of the payment file from the payer. We generally make these funds available on the day the payment file is received, which may be up to 2 days earlier than the scheduled payment date.<br>

					2 Out-of-network ATM withdrawal and over the counter advance fees may apply except at MoneyPass ATMs in a 7-Eleven, or any Allpoint or Visa Plus Alliance ATM.<br>

					3 SpotMe® for Credit Builder is an optional, no interest/no fee overdraft line of credit tied to the Secured Deposit Account. SpotMe on Debit is an optional, no fee service attached to your Chime Checking Account (individually or collectively, “SpotMe”). Eligibility for SpotMe requires $200 or more in qualifying direct deposits to your Chime Checking Account each month.<br>

					Qualifying members will be allowed to overdraw their Chime Checking Account and/or their Secured Deposit Account up to $20 in total, but may be later eligible for a higher combined limit of up to $200 or more based on member’s Chime account history, direct deposit frequency and amount, spending activity and other risk-based factors. Your SpotMe Limit will be displayed to you within the Chime mobile app. You will receive notice of any changes to your SpotMe Limit. Your SpotMe Limit may change at any time, at Chime or its banking partners’ discretion. Although there are no overdraft fees, there may be out-of-network or third party fees associated with ATM transactions or OTC cash withdrawal fees at retailers. SpotMe® won't cover non card transactions, including ACH transfers, Pay Anyone transfers, or Chime Checkbook transactions. SpotMe Terms and Conditions.<br><br>

					<span class="bright">SpotMe® Boost:</span> Boosts are available to eligible Chime members enrolled in SpotMe® and are subject to monthly limits.<br><br>
					4 Cash deposits to a Chime Checking Account are funds transfers made by third parties (who may impose their own fees or limits) and are FDIC-insured up to applicable limits once received by the bank holding the account.<br>

					5 Mobile Check Deposit eligibility is determined by Chime in its sole discretion and may be granted based on various factors including, but not limited to, a member's direct deposit enrollment status.<br><br>

					* Terms and Conditions: In order for the referring Chime member (“Referrer”) to qualify and receive the $100.00 monetary referral reward and $10.00 temporary SpotMe Base Limit increase referral reward, and for the referred person (“Referred”) to qualify and receive the $100.00 monetary referral reward, all of the following conditions must be satisfied: (1) Referrer is part of the SpotMe Referral Incentive referral reward campaign; (2) Referred has not previously opened an Account (“Account”); (3) Referred opened a new Account between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022; (4) Referred opened the new Account using the Referrer’s unique referral link; and (5) Referred received in the new Account a qualifying direct deposit of $200.00 or more within 45 calendar days of opening. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit from your employer, payroll provider, gig economy payer, or benefits payer by Automated Clearing House (ACH) deposit OR Original Credit Transaction (OCT). Bank ACH transfers, Pay Anyone transfers, verification or trial deposits from financial institutions, peer to peer transfers from services such as PayPal, Cash App, or Venmo, mobile check deposits, cash loads or deposits, one-time direct deposits, such as tax refunds and other similar transactions, and any deposit to which Chime deems to not be a qualifying direct deposit are not qualifying direct deposits. Members may earn no more than $50.00 in SpotMe Base Limit referral increase, and may earn no more than $1,000.00 in monetary referral rewards per calendar year (January 1, 2022 - December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2023 – December 31, 2023). No member’s SpotMe limit may exceed $200. Any Referrer SpotMe Base limit increase referral reward will expire 184 calendar days from the Referred receiving a qualifying direct deposit. If an eligible Referrer loses Base Limit eligibility, and the Referred completes the above conditions, the Referrer will receive the $10 temporary SpotMe limit increase referral reward only upon regaining Base Limit eligibility. Referral rewards will generally be provided within two (2) business days after all the above conditions are met. The Referrer’s account must be in good standing in order to receive the referral reward. Referred individuals acknowledge that payment of any referral reward may result in the Referrer’s knowledge of the Referred’s establishment of a new Account or enrollment in a product. Chime reserves the right to cancel or modify the terms of any referral reward offer or terminate a member's eligibility at any time with or without prior notice. Credits of $10 or more will be reported on tax form 1099-INT for new members (Referred). Credits of $600 or more will be reported on tax form 1099-MISC for referring Chime members (Referrers). Banking services are provided by The Bancorp Bank, N.A. or Stride Bank, N.A., Members FDIC.<br>
